GENERAL MEASUREMENT INFO

start date: DOY 132
end date: DOY 262

Replicates with 0.2 added to the number refer to old data that was obtained by recording either 1) a main stem that had its apical meristem die off or 2) a branch that was initially believed to be the apical meristem.

For all species in which this change in measurement occurs, it is probably best to use only the data from the main apical shoot because we should be consistent across all the replicates. This is especially true because the growth of lateral branches is impacted by the suppressive effect of auxin-mediated apical dominance, which we would be ignorant of if we were to assume that lateral shoot growth is equivalent to apical shoot growth.

In SESE, the abscence of lateral branches but rapid growth of branchlets and foliar structures meant that these were mistaken for the apical shoot instead (despite their morphological differences...). Because the branchlets often grow faster than the apical meristem in length, it is also important to ignore the measurements that did not pertain to the apical shoot not necessarily because of apical dominance but maybe just consistency across the replicates.

DATA UPLOADING AND DAMAGE

Data was uploaded at the halfway mark to the shared Google Drive folder "Phenoflex" in the folder "shoot elongation files". Final data after processing is in "shoot_elongation_final".

However, before data could be fully uploaded, rain and wind caused some of the rulers to break off and thus the data was lost. This was generally not an issue, but 4 of the species continued to grow after the first round of data uploading. These 4 were:
 - Betula papyrifera B3
 - Sequoia sempervirens B3
 - Populus tremuloides B3
 - Quercus garryana B3

This is probably not a big problem for QUMA because only 3 of them resprouted with new leaf flushes, but with barely any increment in shoot length (less than a few mm at maximum).

BEPA and SESE continued to grow until DOY 262 when measurements stopped occurring. SESE is safe from data loss as photos were taken before the rain began, so only BEPA and POTR are severely affected. Block 1 trees were sheltered from the rain and thus most likely have their physical data intact.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

Some ideas for better measurement procedure:
 - use acetate strips instead of waterproof paper, as it will not tear under harsh weather conditions
	 - Acetate is also transparent and can be written on with a permanent marker
	 - No need to print ruler marks on it, as the strip itself can just be laid on a ruler after all measurements are taken
	 - can be purchased cheaply from Amazon under baking supplies (cake collars)
 - Cut out cardboard squares or rings and place on top of soil to suppress weed growth and retain moisture, reducing irrigation cost
